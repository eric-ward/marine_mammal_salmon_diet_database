Summary of prey items identiÞed in harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) scats collected from Tugidak Island Alaska from 2001 to 2009. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of relative importance of each prey item during the molting period are shown only for prey species with ³10percent occurrence in diet for at least one collection period in the time series (i.e.\ 2002 molting period). The scenario provided for each of these species denotes whether the relative importance of each species was estimated to be higher by ssFO than BR (Scenario 1)\ higher according to BR than ssFO (Scenario 2)\ or if neither estimation method dominated (Scenario 3). Examples of each scenario are portrayed in Fig. 2.,105,Harbor Seal,M\F,1193,scat sample,Washington,San Juan Islands,D,2005,2008,7--9,Lance et al. 2012,scat sample,,,FO,51.4,,0.6,,,Lance  M. M.
